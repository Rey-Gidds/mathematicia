            Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, angles, dimensions and sizes of a variety of things we see in everyday life. Geometry is derived from Ancient Greek words – ‘Geo’ means ‘Earth’ and ‘metron’ means ‘measurement’. In Euclidean geometry, there are two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional shapes.  
            <br>
            <br>
            In a plane geometry, 2d shapes such as triangles, squares, rectangles, circles are also called flat shapes. In solid geometry, 3d shapes such as a cube, cuboid, cone, etc. are also called solids. The basic geometry is based on points, lines and planes explained in coordinate geometry. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The different types of shapes in geometry help us to understand the shapes day to day life. With the help of geometric concepts, we can calculate the area, perimeter and volume of shapes.

            Geometry is the study of different types of shapes, figures and sizes in Maths or in real life. In geometry, we learn about different angles, transformations and similarities in the figures. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The basics of geometry depend on majorly point, line, angles and plane. All the geometrical shapes are based on these basic geometrical concepts.

            Plane Geometry (Two-dimensional Geometry)
        </div></a><hr size="2px" color="black">
        
            Plane Geometry deals with flat shapes which can be drawn on a piece of paper. These include lines, circles & triangles of two dimensions. Plane geometry is also known as two-dimensional geometry.
            <br>
            <br>
            All the two-dimensional figures have only two measures such as length and breadth. It does not deal with the depth of the shapes. Some examples of plane figures are square, triangle, rectangle, circle, and so on.
            <br>
            <br>
            The important terminologies in plane geometry are:
            <pre>

Point
Line
Angles

        <a name="points">
        <div id="heading">
            Point
        </div></a><hr size="2px" color="black">
        
            A point is a precise location or place on a plane. A dot usually represents them. It is important to understand that a point is not a thing, but a place. Also, note that a point has no dimension; preferably, it has the only position.
        <a name="lines">
        <div id="heading">
            Line
        </div></a><hr size="2px" color="black">
        
            The line is straight (no curves), having no thickness and extends in both directions without end (infinitely). It is important to note that it is the combination of infinite points together to form a line. In geometry, we have a horizontal line and vertical line which are x-axis and y-axis respectively.

            Line Segment – If a line has a starting and an endpoint then it is called a Line Segment.

            In planar geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.

            <b>Acute Angle: </b>– An Acute angle (or Sharp angle) is an angle smaller than a right angle ie. it can range between 0 – 90 degrees.

             <br>
            <b>Obtuse Angle: </b> – An Obtuse angle is more than 90 degrees but is less than 180 degrees.
            <br><br>
            <b>Right Angle: </b>– An angle of 90 degrees.
            <br><br>
            <b>Straight Angle: </b>– An angle of 180 degrees is a straight angle, i.e. the angle formed by a straight line

            A plane figure that is bounded by a finite chain of straight line segments closing in a loop to form a closed polygonal chain or circuit.

        The name ‘poly’ refers to multiple. An n-gon is a polygon with n sides; for example, a triangle is a 3-gon polygon.

        General Formula for Sum of internal Angles of a polygon –

        Sum of internal angles of a polygon = (n-2)*180

        A Circle is a simple closed shape. From a certain point called the centre, all points of a circle are of same consistent distance, i.e. the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from the centre is constant.

        <b>Similarity</b>– Two figures are said to be similar if they have the same shape or have an equal angle but do not have the same size.

        <b>Congruence</b>–  Two figures are said to be Congruent if they have the same shape and size. Thus, they are totally equal.
