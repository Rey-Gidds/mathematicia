                Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns. The word comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthema),
                meaning "science, knowledge, or learning", and is sometimes shortened to math or maths.
                Prehistoric Africans started using numbers to track time about 20,000 years ago.
                The Rhind Papyrus (1650 BCE) shows how ancient Egyptians worked out arithmetic and geometry problems in the first math textbook.
                Babylonian mathematicians were the first known to create a character for zero.

            <h2><i><u>#Problem Solving in mathematics</u></i></h2>
            <div id="content">
                Mathematics solves problems by using logic. One of the main tools of logic used by mathematicians is deduction.Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true (called a proof) is just as important as the fact that it is true, and this reason is often found using deduction. 
                Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of scientific thinking, 
                which might rely on experiments or on interviews.
                Logic and reasoning are used by mathematicians to create general rules, 
                which are an important part of mathematics. 
                These rules leave out information that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. 
                By finding general rules, mathematics solves many problems at the same time as these rules can be used on other problems.
                These rules can be called theorems (if they have been proven) or conjectures (if it is not known if they are true yet).
                Most mathematicians use non-logical and creative reasoning in order to find a logical proof.
                Sometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, 
                ideas and rules are chosen because they are considered simple or neat.
                On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; 
                this has happened many times in the past. In general, 
                studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us understand the world better. 
                Some examples of math problems are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, calculus, fractions and decimals.
                Algebra problems are solved by evaluating certain variables. 
                A calculator answers every math problem in the four basic arithmetic operations.

            <h2><i><u>#Numbers In Mathematics</u></i></h2>
        <div id="content">
        <pre>
        The Number System consist of many types,
        The following are the number system types:
        <ol>    
        <li><b><u>Natural Numbers</b></u>:</li> 

            These numbers start from one (1) and go upto infinity 
            which is another interesting mathematical term which we will discuss later about.This only includes the Positive Numbers.
            eg:-
                1,2,3,4,5.......♾️
        
        <li><b><u>Integers</u></b>:</li>
    
            These numbers start from zero and goes to both sides , towards positive infinity and negative infinity as well.
            eg:-
                
                -♾️.....-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,....♾️
                
        <li><b><u>Whole Numbers</u></b>:</li>

            These resemble the Natural Numbers category as they include the number 0 and goes upto infinity.
            eg:-
                0,1,2,3,4,5.......♾️    
        
        <li><b><u>Rational Numbers</u></b>:</li>

            This set includes the Fractional Numbers in p/q form and goes upto infinity
            eg:-
                All the Decimal numbers you see and the whole integer set all are included in the example of the rational numbers set
        
        <li><b><u>Real Numbers</u></b>:</li>

            This set involves all the above set as well as all those numbers which have indefinite value or 
            the decimal numbers having non-terminating, 
            non-repeating value or non-terminating , repeating values
            eg:-

                √2, 22/7(PI) , and many more....
