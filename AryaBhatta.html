        Aryabhatta was a well-known astronomer and mathematician. He was born in the Indian state of Bihar, in the town of Kusumapura (now Patna). Despite his enormous contributions to mathematics, science, and astronomy, he has received no credit in the history of science. He authored his famous “Aryabhatiya” at the age of 25. He understood the idea of zero and how to employ huge numbers up to 10.He was the first to compute the value of ‘pi’ to the fourth decimal point with precision. He was the one who came up with the formula for computing the areas of triangles and circles.

        Aryabhatta’s birthplace and year are still conjectures based on his works and influences. It was said in one of his well-known books, Aryabhatiya, To be clear, the manuscript Aryabhatiya was published 3600 years into the Kaliyug, although his findings and writings were discovered much later. He always regarded Kusumapura, Pataliputra, which is now Patna, Bihar, to be his birthplace. The location of his birth and the family into which he was born is still unclear.
        <br><br>
        Pataliputra, the capital of the Gupta Empire’s Kusumapura province, was a prominent learning institution and the heart of a communication network. As a result, works from all over the world were easily transported to the location, allowing Aryabhatta to make significant mathematical and astronomical advances. He was said to be the head of his Kusumapura school, Kulpa. Later, to pursue his passion for astronomy, he proceeded to Nalanda University in Pataliputra, where rumors of his becoming the president of his university persisted.

        This book is also known as Arya-status-ash, which means “aryabhatta’s 108” since there are 108 verses in the text. It’s written as a sutra, which is a collection of aphorisms, which is a short way of expressing a statement or a scientific principle.
        <br><br>
        These words, in the shape of 13 introduction verses, are his works that provide a means to recall difficult computations in a simple style. The first chapter, Gitikapada, includes 13 verses and is broken into four chapters or padas. It is about cosmology. In a maha yuga, the planetary revolutions are said to last up to 4.32 million years.

        Indian Mathematical Literature was widely mentioned in Aryabhatiya. The Vedic method of solving mathematical problems was investigated, and it is unexpected that it has lasted to the present day. Algebra, arithmetic, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry were all studied in detail. He calculated using the Sanskrutik tradition, which was popular throughout the Vedic period.
        <br><br>
        Aryabhatta was awarded the title of ‘Father Of Algebra’ because of his remarkable grasp and explanation of planetary systems employing it. Aryabhatta calculated the value of pi to two decimal places, which was 3.14. He also employed null coefficients and was well aware of the dangers of using zero in such a situation. In contrast to Brahmi numbers, he employed Sanskritic tradition, which was primarily denoted by letters and alphabets.

        The world spins daily on its axis around the sun, and the movement of stars appears to be owing to the relative motion induced by the rotation of the earth, as Aryabhatta correctly said. This was in contrast to the widely held assumption at the time that the sky rotated. Heliocentrism is defined as the axial rotation of celestial bodies, according to mathematical evidence.

        Aryabhatta’s work had a significant influence and impact on Indian astrological traditions and other civilizations. His studies, investigations, and calculations were translated into various languages to benefit other astronomers. The Arabian translation was most prominent during the Islamic Golden Age. Great Arabian mathematicians like Al-Biruni and Al-Khawarizmi, who thought the Earth rotated on its axis, referenced some of his findings.
        <br><br>
        Trigonometry was born from aryabhatta’s concepts of cosine, sine, inverse sine, and versed sine. He was the first mathematician to calculate sine and versine (1-cost) tables from 0 to 180 degrees in a 3.75-degree span with four decimal places of precision.
        <br><br>
        The contemporary names for trigonometric functions, sine, and cosine, are derived from his use of the Sanskrit terms “jya” and “Kojya. His astronomical calculating methods were also well-liked by other astronomers. They were commonly used in the creation of Arabic astrological tables known as “zijes.”

        Since Aryabhatta, a scientist’s contributions have never been the same. In terms of scientific understanding and worth that made a difference in the globe, he genuinely made the world recognize India. He disputed and opposed numerous popular views at the time, and via computations, he presented evidence that they were correct. And, despite the passage of time, his art remains meticulously accurate. Aryabhatta was one of the rare scientists who completed an incredible responsibility of labor throughout their lives. His efforts are recognised throughout India. In the Islamic world, his work was well-received, particularly his astronomical findings, which were published in Arabic in the eighth century.
